# **ECS Research Day Judge Assignment System**  


## **Overview**  
This project was developed during the **ECS Hackathon**, a 48-hour coding competition hosted by **Syracuse University College of Engineering and Computer Science**. Our goal was to design an **automated judge assignment system** for **ECS Research Day**, ensuring fairness, efficiency, and ease of use.  

## **Key Features**  
ðŸ”¹ **NLP-Driven Expertise Matching** â€“ Judges were assigned based on their expertise using natural language processing.  
ðŸ”¹ **Constraint-Based Scheduling** â€“ Ensured balanced workloads and optimal assignments.  
ðŸ”¹ **Real-Time Scoring Interface** â€“ Provided a seamless evaluation experience.  
ðŸ”¹ **Automated Ranking Algorithm** â€“ Simplified the selection of top research posters.  
ðŸ”¹ **End-to-End Execution** â€“ Successfully deployed and ran flawlessly on the first try.  

## **Impact**  
Our system streamlined the evaluation process, allowing judges to focus on research rather than logistics. The success of our solution at the event highlighted the power of **intuitive design and automation** in academic settings.
